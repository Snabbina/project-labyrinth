ðŸ—º  Project Labyrinth
This project is an app which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.
Mobile first approach. 
 
## The problem
How to make the API calls around Redux using thunks.To process request and response effectively. How to structure the redux store to suit the data.To be able to send JSON in the body of a request. This project has been made as a pair-programming project.

The project's backend is designed so that there is some delay until the request returns from the server. Therfore the usage of thunks is a good way of making sure that the user doesn't make another action until the response is received from the server.

Tools and techniques used:
Redux-toolkit
React
Redux
JavaScript vanillia
Postman
API
Thunks
Styled components
